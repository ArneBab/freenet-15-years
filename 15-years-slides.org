1999 Freenet started as a thesis by Ian Clarke, known to friends as /sanity/.

In 2007 it added its Darknet-Mode:

*** Friend-to-Friend like ...

The Friend-to-Friend Darknet mode works conceptually *like WhatsApp*,
where you give a Facebook server your friends’ phone numbers and then
you can talk *directly*:

*** But without the server

Different from WhatsApp, *Freenet avoids the central server*, so no one
gets your friends’ phone numbers.

*** Friend-of-a-Friend routing

By building a network on friend-connections where others can find what
you write even when you’re offline, Friend-to-Friend Freenet enables
global pseudonymous publishing that is very hard to block.

*** Chaos Computer Congress 2005

The new Friend-to-Friend Freenet was [[https://player.vimeo.com/video/22488244?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0][presented]] by Ian Clarke and Oskar
Sandberg at the 22c3 in 2005, and it showed a beautiful method for
confidential communication and censorship resistance.

*** The Attack

Then Christian Grothoff et al. found a flaw. And [[http://grothoff.org/christian/pitchblack.pdf][proved it]].

*** “But Opennet works”

For 14 years we lived in denial, because “Opennet works”.

** 15 years
*** 15 years

That’s why now is the time to talk about the changes in Freenet
since 2007. 15 years of continuous improvements to the
Friend-to-Friend Freenet network.

Which is a @@latex:\colorbox{darkgray}{\textcolor{orange}{@@Darknet@@latex:}}@@, because that
is the only privacy preserving way to make this work:

****  protect the privacy of persons sharing data              :B_alertblock:

/This covers the needs for protection expected from a secure data broker … for Multi-Party Data Exchange in IoT for Health/
--E. Benoit and J. Sliwa, Bern University of Applied Sciences, Switzerland, 2020,

*** 14 years to mitigate pitch-black

In 2005 Freenet showed that an Opennet with arbitrary connections
cannot ever be secured well enough, but that a friend-to-friend model can
be. In 2007 it was working, but the pitch black attack was published
which showed how to utterly destroy that friend-to-friend network.

It would take us 14 years to mitigate the attack. During that time
Freenet progressed a lot. And Opennet lived far longer than we
expected.

*** Features and Friction: 15 years of Freenet development

Those 15 years — 14 years of development plus the one year since the
mitigation was in place — shaped Freenet from a tool for the dedicated
into an easy to use platform that covers the needs of most
communication from Social networking over Blogging to Video-on-Demand
without servers or central point of failure.

But let us begin with the lost: technologies that faltered.

In its 22 years of existence, Freenet has seen tools that did not
stand the test of time — either because their model did not work out,
or because they did not see maintenance or were replaced by newer
tools.

*** High-Impact Tasks
  :PROPERTIES:
  :BEAMER_opt: allowframebreaks,label=
  :END:

- Fix a *release-blocker* for 8.0 from the [[https://github.com/freenet/wiki/wiki/Roadmap][Roadmap]]

- *Packaging*: create [[https://github.com/freenet/debian][Debian package]] ([[https://www.mail-archive.com/devl@freenetproject.org/msg49740.html][info]]), Guix package, beta-channel

- *Plugin* furbishing: Freemail, Keepalive, Freereader, Shoeshop,
  Floghelper, Flircp, JFniki: workflows enjoyable, cope with Freenet
  as proxy

- Port plugin buildsystems to gradle for easier *CI* ([[https://www.mail-archive.com/devl@freenetproject.org/msg55177.html][info1]], [[https://www.mail-archive.com/devl@freenetproject.org/msg55180.html][info2]])

- *Decentralized programming*: port [[https://hg.sr.ht/~arnebab/infocalypse/browse][infocalypse]] to python3, improve its [[https://github.com/ArneBab/plugin-Infocalypse-WebUI][WoT integration]]

- *Content filters* for modern codecs can make Freenet viable for
  realtime streaming: [[https://freenet.mantishub.io/view.php?id=7163][fix vorbis]], opus for live audio streaming (
  [[https://www.draketo.de/software/stream-over-freenet][stream into Freenet]] ), webm with vp9 (video streaming) and av1
  (video on demand)

- *[[https://github.com/freenet-mobile/app][Freenet Mobile]]*: ref exchange as with [[https://github.com/ArneBab/Icicle][Icicle]], spread via NFC and
  similar, improve [[https://github.com/DennisRein/free-chat-2][FreeChat]], spread via Messengers (WhatsApp, Signal,
  Telegram, Threema, DeltaChat, ...)

- Enable *clicking* on =freenet:CHK@...=-Links (and
  =freenet:SSK@...= and =freenet:USK@...= and
  =magnet:?xt=urn:freenet:CHK:...=) on websites.
  Browser-plugin needs [[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1687099][allow-listing the freenet: schema (issue)]]

- *Stream*-into-Freenet GUI

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Freenet/comments/lblvdq/how_would_you_improve_freenet/gm2yrxs][Revamp]] *F2F workflow* and communication (mobile first).

- Revamp *initial page*: help sections, links, official plugins.

- *REST API* (start with [[https://github.com/Bombe/fresta][fresta]]) and API documentation, examples and
  documentation

- Simplify updating and changing *dependencies* over Freenet.

- Make the *noderef parser* work *always*, even if linebreaks are lost,
  unicode is mis-escaped, or email shows the user 7-bit ASCII
  encoding.
